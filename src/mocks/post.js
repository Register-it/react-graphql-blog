  Preact is an alternative to the popular React library. It has fewer complexities and performs faster in comparison to React due to its smaller size of 3kb. Preact also uses the ES6 API similar to React.

It was developed by Jason Miller to provide a feature set similar to React in a smaller package. Preact has the fastest virtual DOM libraries and diff implementation. Some of its salient features are:

* Increased performance
* Decreased size
* Efficient memory usage
* Compatibility with the React API
* Extensive browser support including IE7 and IE8 by using polyfills
* Simpler code which is easier to understand

Uber, Lyft, and Housing.com are just a few of the organizations that have migrated to Preact and benefited both in terms of increased performance and reduced size. 

The case study of Uber is well known. Uber migrated from its native app to a web client that provides an app-like experience via web browsers. The move to Preact ensured that browsers loaded faster, resulting in an increased number of ride requests.
    
  It's very easy to make some words **bold** and other words *italic* with Markdown. You can even [link to Google!](http://google.com)

  Sometimes you want numbered lists:

1. One
2. Two
3. Three

Sometimes you want bullet points:

* Start a line with a star
* Profit!

Alternatively,

- Dashes work just as well
- And if you have sub points, put two spaces before the dash or star:
  - Like this
  - And this

  If you want to embed images, this is how you do it:

# Structured documents

Sometimes it's useful to have different levels of headings to structure your documents. Start lines with a \`#\` to create headings. Multiple \`##\` in a row denote smaller heading sizes.

### This is a third-tier heading

You can use one \`#\` all the way up to \`######\` six for different heading sizes.

If you'd like to quote someone, use the > character before the line:

> Coffee. The finest organic suspension ever devised... I beat the Borg with it.
> - Captain Janeway


\`\`\`
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
\`\`\`

And if you'd like to use syntax highlighting, include the language:

\`\`\`javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
\`\`\`


GitHub supports many extras in Markdown that help you reference and link to people. If you ever want to direct a comment at someone, you can prefix their name with an @ symbol: Hey @kneath — love your sweater!

But I have to admit, tasks lists are my favorite:

- [x] This is a complete item
- [ ] This is an incomplete item

When you include a task list in the first comment of an Issue, you will see a helpful progress bar in your list of issues. It works in Pull Requests, too!

And, of course emoji!
